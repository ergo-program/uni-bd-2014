# IndexedDB App
## Laboratorio de Bases de Datos 2014
## Universidad Nacional de Itapúa - Ingeniería en Informática

### Introduction

This is an introduction to Javascript apps with offline database using IndexedDB API and EmberJS. Moreover, this is an example of a non-SQL or non-relational database. It's up to the student to make a further research about related subjects such as WebSQL, libraries to manipulate DOM, libraries to abstract underlying device platform, libraries to enforce design patterns, synchronization with cloud and so on.

### About the App

This app will serve as a classmate contact list and a course TODO list. The target user for this app is any student of this course. 
The student(user) should be able to create, read, update, delete (CRUD) classmates info  _tasks_ for a TODO list. 

In the future, when we get to the server backend of this app, the classmates should be able to share tasks with each other.

### About the work

The work is divided in issues in this repo's issue tracker in the milestone [TP#1 - IndexedDB app](https://github.com/hisapy/uni-bd-2014/issues?milestone=1&state=open). Basically, the student will have to complete a code skeleton that will provided in this repo's master branch. Either way the student is free to modify all the code at will.
